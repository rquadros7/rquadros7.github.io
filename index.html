        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Welcome! My name is Risa. I work as a Marketing Executive for a Private Equity company in London, UK.
            I have been learning how to code with Codecademy and wanted to create this site to share my 
            achievements with you, so please feel free to explore this site and take a look at some of the 
            projects that I have been working on. 
        </p>

                <h3>Excursion</h3>
                <p>This minimalist landing page is designed to advertise a mobile app called "Excursion". 
                    Skills used include: HTML, CSS, Command Line, Git and GitHub.</p>

                <h3>Colmar Academy</h3>
                <p>For this project, I was given a project wireframe and was tasked with making informed
                    decisions regarding colour and typography to create this mobile responsive landing page.</p>

                <h3>Tea Cozy</h3>
                <p>Who doesn't love tea? Sure, it's a fictional tea shop but I still created website for it 
                    by using a design spec that was provided by Codecademy and by using HTML and CSS.</p>
