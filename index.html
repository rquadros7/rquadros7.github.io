        <p>Welcome! My name is Risa and I work as a Marketing Executive for a Private Equity company in London, UK.
            I have been learning how to code with Codecademy and wanted to create this site to share my 
            achievements with you, so please feel free to explore this site and take a look at some of the 
            projects that I have been working on.
